# week03_cookie-clicker

I found this assigment the most fun out of all of them, as I love maths and logic problems, I felt this was more up my avenue than the image gallery (I'm not the greatest artist!)

ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I achieved all of the requirements, and for the stretch goals I added some hover animations, error handling, I used a single function to handle all upgrades. Also, as an extra, I added a refresh game function, which removes items from local storage and sets the cookies back to 0 and the cps back to 1. 

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
Adding sound effects and customisable game options.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Honestly, I could have done it with more time, effort and research, however I tried to perfect the visual animations and representations alot and add extras lik the refresh game button.

Summary:

With this project, I essentially just used Sam's demos and the moodle workshops as guides. The fetching data from an api demo was the outline for getting the shop data and using the DOM to add elements for each json item. Also, the moodle workshop where we created a stopwatch really helped in creating the cookie incrementer every second, and the local storage moodle really helped save each increment/upgrade/reset to the local storage.

External rescources/Things I had to research:

-I stole some CSS from previous projects and the internet/AI to make the buttons darker on hover or tarsnform on hover

-Used AI to add some comments to the CSS to make it easier to understand when I look back on it.

-I used codeacademy to resarch how to delete items off local storage for the reset button

-I used MDN and other websites for reminders on CSS and JS throughout.

EXTRA INFO:

I have the page set up so when you click the reset button, the number of cookies you have and cps will be reset back to 0 and 1 respectively, and taken off local storage. If you just refresh the page, the game will load the data from the local storage to get the value of cookeis and CPS.
